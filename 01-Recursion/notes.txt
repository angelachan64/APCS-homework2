Path finding is a search function
blind search
depth first search - try to go as deep down one path as we can before we come
      back
state space search
nodes represent things, edges connect nodes
huristic search (blind search) blindly tries all possibilities
      always try to move closer
      puzzle: move piece closer to final destination

implicit data structure - graph exists behind method, creating/destroying nodes
      as program works

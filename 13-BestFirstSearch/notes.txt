- specification of a graph
  - a graph is a collection of nodes and edges
    - nodes sometimes called vertices
    - a node holds stuff, an edge connects nodes
------------------------------EXAMPLES OF GRAPHS--------------------------------
o - this is a graph
o o - this is a graph

o-o - this is a connected component

o-o o - this is a graph with 2 components

o-o
 \  - this is a fully connected graph (the nodes are all connected)
  o

o-3-o
7\ /2 - this is a weighted graph (each of the edges has a value) (there is a 
  o   	cost associated with each of the edges)

o---o
 \ /  - this is a cycle (you can get from a node back to itself)
  o   - you can have several cycles in a graph

o---o
|\ /|
| X | - this graph has several cycles in it
|/ \|
o---o

o->o
| ^   - this is a directed graph (you can go one way but not the other in this
V/      case
o

o<-->o
^
|      - this is also a directed graph
v
o
--------------------------------WHAT IS A TREE?---------------------------------
- a tree is an acyclic graph with one node designated as the root
- a tree is either empty or has one or more nodes
  - each node can have 0 or more children and one node is designated as the root

  o o
   \|\
o---o o---o
|   | |       - this is TECHNICALLY a tree

to facilitate things, trees are typically shown top down or left to right

root - starting node
child - node parent node leads to
 - siblings come from the same parent node
parent - node connecting to child nodes
leaf - node with no children
ancestors - any nodes down the path from n to the root
descendents - children, their children, etc
path - follows nodes down
height - the length of the longest root to leaf path

              0        - 0 is the root, 0 is an ancestor of A
             / \
            1   2      - 2 is a leaf, 1&2 are children of 0
           / \
          3   4	       - 3&4 are siblings, 4 is the parent of 5&6
             / \
            5   6      - 6 is part of the path from the root to A
           /|\   \
          7 8 9   A    - A is a descendent of 0
           / \   / \
          B   C D   E  - the height of the tree is 5

a tree is full if it has 0 or the maximum number of allowed children
- i.e. if you restrict the number of children per node to 4 children, the tree
  is full if the nodes are all leaves or all have 4 children

1. get a pointer to the node to delete and its parent (T2 is at parent)
   (same thing as the search part of insert but you stop at the node to delete)
   a. T is a leaf
      point T2's left or right to null
   b. T has one child
      point T2's left or right, as appropriate, to T's only child
   c. T has two children
      find the largest in the left subtree (or smallest in right)
      copy data from L into T
      remove from (T.getLeft(),L.getData())
